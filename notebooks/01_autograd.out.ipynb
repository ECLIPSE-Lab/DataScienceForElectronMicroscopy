    "Recall from Section Calculus that calculating derivatives is the crucial step in all the optimization algorithms that we will use to train deep networks. While the calculations are straightforward, working them out by hand can be tedious and error-prone, and these issues only grow as our models become more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately all modern deep learning frameworks take this work off our plates by offering *automatic differentiation* (often shortened to *autograd*). As we pass data through each successive function, the framework builds a *computational graph* that tracks how each value depends on others. To calculate derivatives, automatic differentiation works backwards through this graph applying the chain rule. The computational algorithm for applying the chain rule in this fashion is called *backpropagation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "While autograd libraries have become a hot concern over the past decade, they have a long history. In fact the earliest references to autograd date back over half of a century :cite:`Wengert.1964`. The core ideas behind modern backpropagation date to a PhD thesis from 1980 :cite:`Speelpenning.1980` and were further developed in the late 1980s :cite:`Griewank.1989`. While backpropagation has become the default method for computing gradients, it is not the only option. For instance, the Julia programming language employs forward propagation :cite:`Revels.Lubin.Papamarkou.2016`. Before exploring methods, let’s first master the autograd package."

As such, `f(a) / a` is a vector of constant entries and, moreover, `f(a) / a` needs to match the gradient of `f(a)` with respect to `a`."

    "Dynamic control flow is very common in deep learning. For instance, when processing text, the computational graph depends on the length of the input. In these cases, automatic differentiation becomes vital for statistical modeling since it is impossible to compute the gradient *a priori*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "You have now gotten a taste of the power of automatic differentiation. The development of libraries for calculating derivatives both automatically and efficiently has been a massive productivity booster for deep learning practitioners, liberating them so they can focus on less menial. Moreover, autograd lets us design massive models for which pen and paper gradient computations would be prohibitively time consuming. Interestingly, while we use autograd to *optimize* models (in a statistical sense) the *optimization* of autograd libraries themselves (in a computational sense) is a rich subject of vital interest to framework designers. Here, tools from compilers and graph manipulation are leveraged to compute results in the most expedient and memory-efficient manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, try to remember these basics: (i) attach gradients to those variables with respect to which we desire derivatives; (ii) record the computation of the target value; (iii) execute the backpropagation function; and (iv) access the resulting gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Why is the second derivative much more expensive to compute than the first derivative?\n",
    "2.  After running the function for backpropagation, immediately run it again and see what happens. Investigate.\n",
    "3.  In the control flow example where we calculate the derivative of `d` with respect to `a`, what would happen if we changed the variable `a` to a random vector or a matrix? At this point, the result of the calculation `f(a)` is no longer a scalar. What happens to the result? How do we analyze this?\n",
    "4.  Let $f(x) = \\sin(x)$. Plot the graph of $f$ and of its derivative $f'$. Do not exploit the fact that $f'(x) = \\cos(x)$ but rather use automatic differentiation to get the result.\n",
    "5.  Let $f(x) = ((\\log x^2) \\cdot \\sin x) + x^{-1}$. Write out a dependency graph tracing results from $x$ to $f(x)$.\n",
    "6.  Use the chain rule to compute the derivative $\\frac{df}{dx}$ of the aforementioned function, placing each term on the dependency graph that you constructed previously.\n",
    "7.  Given the graph and the intermediate derivative results, you have a number of options when computing the gradient. Evaluate the result once starting from $x$ to $f$ and once from $f$ tracing back to $x$. The path from $x$ to $f$ is commonly known as *forward differentiation*, whereas the path from $f$ to $x$ is known as backward differentiation.\n",
    "8.  When might you want to use forward, and when backward, differentiation? Hint: consider the amount of intermediate data needed, the ability to parallelize steps, and the size of matrices and vectors involved."

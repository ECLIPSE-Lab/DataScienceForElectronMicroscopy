Segmentation Task\n\n    We will use the HRTEM dataset from \"A robust synthetic data generation framework for machine learning in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)\" by @rangel2024robust to implement a segmentation model.\n    The goal is to segment nanoparticles in HRTEM images.\n\n    Please use the article  \"A robust synthetic data generation framework for machine learning in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)\" by @rangel2024robust as a starting point for your implementation.\n\n    The datast contains pairs of HRTEM images and ground truth segmentations. \n\n2. VAE & Dimensionality Reduction\n\n    We will use the dataset from \"Uncovering material deformations via machine learning combined with four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy\" by @shi2022uncovering to implement a dimensionality reduction model and cluster 4DSTEM data.\n\n    The goal is to learn a mapping from 4DSTEM data to a lower-dimensional embedding where you can perform clustering to identify different deformation modes.\n\n    Please use the article  \"Uncovering material deformations via machine learning combined with four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy\" by @shi2022uncovering as a starting point for your implementation.    \n\n3. Denoising\n\n    We will use the dataset from \"Unsupervised deep denoising for four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy\" by @sadri2024unsupervised to implement a denoising model for 4DSTEM data. \n    \n    The goal is to learn a mapping from noisy to clean 4DSTEM data.\n\n    Please use the article  \"Unsupervised deep denoising for four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy\" by @sadri2024unsupervised as a starting point for your implementation.\n\n    The article contains pytorch code for the model. \n    \n    Learn how to adapt it to your needs and try to replicate the results on the SrTiO3_High_mag_Low_dose.npy and SrTiO3_High_mag_High_dose.npy datasets.\n\n4. Image-to-Image Translation\n\n    We will use a simulated X-ray image dataset with pairs of projected thickness and phase contrast images to implement an Image to image translation model. \n    \n    The goal is to learn a mapping from phase contrast images to projected thickness images. \n    \n    This is usually a task that is solved with multiple measurements and a physical model of the imaging process. \n    \n    Here we will try to learn this mapping from simulated data. \n    Please use the article \"Multi-resolution convolutional neural networks for inverse problems\" by @wang2020multi as a starting point for your implementation.\n\n## Lecture 5: Mixed Bag (24.06.2025)  {#sec-lecture6}\n\n- Project presentations\n- Generative Adversarial Networks\n\n## Lecture 6: Gaussian Processes Introduction (01.07.2025) {#sec-lecture7}\n\n- Introduction to Gaussian Processes  \n\n## Lecture 7: Gaussian Processes Applications (08.07.2025) {#sec-lecture8}\n\n- Bayesian Optimization\n- Active Learning\n- Deep Kernel Learning\n\n## Lecture 8: TBD (15.07.2025) {#sec-lecture9}\n\n- TBD\n\n\n## Lecture 9: Repetition (29.07.2025) {#sec-lecture11}\n\n- Repetition and Preparation for the Exam\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n",

## Miniproject (10.6. - 24.6.2025) concurrent to lectures {#sec-lecture5}

In the miniproject, you will test multiple deep neural network architectures on one of four microscopy-related tasks.
You should summarize your results in a short presentation (5 minutes + 2 minutes discussion) and deliver a Jupyter Notebook with your code and results.
The miniproject will be graded and will count as 40% towards your final grade.

1. Segmentation Task

    We will use the HRTEM dataset from "A robust synthetic data generation framework for machine learning in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)" by @rangel2024robust to implement a segmentation model.
    The goal is to segment nanoparticles in HRTEM images.

    Please use the article  "A robust synthetic data generation framework for machine learning in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)" by @rangel2024robust as a starting point for your implementation.

    The datast contains pairs of HRTEM images and ground truth segmentations. 

2. VAE & Dimensionality Reduction

    We will use the dataset from "Uncovering material deformations via machine learning combined with four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy" by @shi2022uncovering to implement a dimensionality reduction model and cluster 4DSTEM data.

    The goal is to learn a mapping from 4DSTEM data to a lower-dimensional embedding where you can perform clustering to identify different deformation modes.

    Please use the article  "Uncovering material deformations via machine learning combined with four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy" by @shi2022uncovering as a starting point for your implementation.    

3. Denoising

    We will use the dataset from "Unsupervised deep denoising for four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy" by @sadri2024unsupervised to implement a denoising model for 4DSTEM data. 
    
    The goal is to learn a mapping from noisy to clean 4DSTEM data.

    Please use the article  "Unsupervised deep denoising for four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy" by @sadri2024unsupervised as a starting point for your implementation.

    The article contains pytorch code for the model. 
    
    Learn how to adapt it to your needs and try to replicate the results on the SrTiO3_High_mag_Low_dose.npy and SrTiO3_High_mag_High_dose.npy datasets.

4. Image-to-Image Translation

    We will use a simulated X-ray image dataset with pairs of projected thickness and phase contrast images to implement an Image to image translation model. 
    
    The goal is to learn a mapping from phase contrast images to projected thickness images. 
    
    This is usually a task that is solved with multiple measurements and a physical model of the imaging process. 
    
    Here we will try to learn this mapping from simulated data. 
    Please use the article "Multi-resolution convolutional neural networks for inverse problems" by @wang2020multi as a starting point for your implementation.
